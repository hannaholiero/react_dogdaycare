# My very first React MERN/CRUD-app!

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

[Vitejs/plugin-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vitejs/plugin-react) uses Babel for Fast Refresh
[Vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses SWC for Fast Refresh
